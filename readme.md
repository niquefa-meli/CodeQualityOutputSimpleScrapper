# Python scrapper to check CodeQuality Report in local directory

To the first commit, the project successfully scarp all the `*.java.html` files in the `code_quality_output_folder` example code quality output. Note: the `code_quality_output_folder` folder is included in the .gitignore file, but there is where the program will search for files with suffix `SUFFIX_TO_DETECT = ".java.html"`

# Python version

This repository is made in Python 3.6.13 and pip3 (version 22.1.2). Make sure you have those installed in your system.

## Use virtual environment
* A good idea for this project, is to use a virtual environment, you could set up one with: [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
* To create the virtual environment: `virtualenv env`
* To activate it:`source env/bin/activate`
* To install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* To deactivate the virtual environment run `deactivate`

## Running the program

After being in the virtual environment and installing all dependencies, to run de program simply run `python3 run.py`. This should look something like:

`(venv) âžœ  PythonCodeQualityScraper git:(main) python3 run.py`

To get the output in a text file, run:  `python3 run.py > output_example.txt` to get the output in the file `output_example.txt`

## Output format

The output will look like the output_example.txt

First it will be an aggregated by file, the issues have the digit character deleted to be grouped easily.

At the end it will be the aggregated sorted by issue count in all files, the format for all issues count is `issueCount : issue description`.

And at the end it will show the ordered by same issue count, and three messages: amount of processed files, the total issues in all files and the total number of different issue types.

## Unit testing and test coverage
To check the test coverage, run `coverage run  -m unittest discover -v` and then run `coverage report`.

Last coverage report run result:
